DriverPass porject was project that the client, Liam, wanted. This applictaion would be used by instructors and students to help aid in students passing their driving test. 

For this project, I feel like I did well in determining the needs of the client to come up with a vaulable ptotype. If I had to choose, I would go through and redo the diagrams, giving them more detail and going further in depth. 

To interpret the needs of the user, I put my self in their position to see what I would want to do if I was using the application. It it important to consider the needs of the user to ensure that the the UI/UX is good for the application, but also to make sure that the user can do everything in the application that they may need to do. 

When approaching the design of software, I first gather the requirements from the client then I translate that to actual functions of a user. Then I design a wireframe for the project. In the future, I would dig deeper into the actions of the user to deeper understand the functionality of the application to analyze the degin.
